# About
This site (and the repository it's generated from) exists to help demonstrate and walk you through deploying a PowerShell Private Gallery to Azure via Azure Resource Manager templates, PowerShell Desired State Configurations, and some version controlled scripts all executed via Visual Studio Services' builds.

The project is broken up into a couple of pieces:

1. Getting Started
2. Step-By-Step
3. Concepts

## Getting Started
The *Getting Started* section exists to help you get the prerequisite tasks accomplished and help you to get ready for the *Step-By-Step* section.
In it you'll find information on forking this repository, setting up VSTS, and preparing your Azure subscription.

## Step-By-Step
The *Step-By-Step* section is exactly what it says on the label: a step-by-step guide to deploying the PowerShell Private Gallery.
This section will take you from having the prerequisites in place through deployment to operational validation and package uploading/downloading.

## Concepts
During the *Step-By-Step* process you'll occasionally be pointed to a link over in the *Concepts* section.
These documents are explanations of terminology, dives into theory, or just tangents on topics that don't directly correlate to getting the private gallery deployed but are still useful to know.

## This Repository
This repository and the project are living things - expect to see the topics and guides updated and fixed over time.

Speaking of errors and corrections, I immediately claim responsibility for every single error or problem you find here.
*Please* let me know when you come across spelling or grammer errors, code errors, inconsistencies, or other problems with the documentation or the configurations/templates.

If you have ideas for improving the project, templates, configurations, scripts, documentation, or anything else, file an issue or launch a pull request! Help is *definitely* welcome on this!

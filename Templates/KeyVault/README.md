# Create Key Vault

This template creates a Key Vault. For more information, go to: http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/key-vault/

By default, this will create a key vault called PSGVault in the MGTS subscription under Michael Lombardi (we need to establish a service principal for these actions).

This vault can be used for template deployments, vm deployments, and disk encryption.

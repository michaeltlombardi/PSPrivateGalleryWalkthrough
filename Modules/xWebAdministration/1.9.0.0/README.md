# xWebAdministration

The **xWebAdministration** module contains the **xIisModule**, **xWebAppPool**, **xWebsite**, **xWebApplication**, **xWebVirtualDirectory**, and **xWebConfigKeyValue** DSC resources for creating and configuring various IIS artifacts.

## Contributing
Please check out common DSC Resources [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/PowerShell/DscResource.Kit/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

    * **Protocol**: The protocol of the binding. This property is required. The acceptable values for this property are: `http`, `https`, `msmq.formatname`, `net.msmq`, `net.pipe`, `net.tcp`.
    * **BindingInformation**: The binding information in the form a colon-delimited string that includes the IP address, port, and host name of the binding. This property is ignored for `http` and `https` bindings if at least one of the following properties is specified: **IPAddress**, **Port**, **HostName**.
    * **IPAddress**: The IP address of the binding. This property is only applicable for `http` and `https` bindings. The default value is `*`.
    * **Port**: The port of the binding. The value must be a positive integer between `1` and `65535`. This property is only applicable for `http` (the default value is `80`) and `https` (the default value is `443`) bindings.

## Examples

### Registering PHP

When configuring an IIS Application that uses PHP, you first need to register the PHP CGI module with IIS.
The following **xPhp** configuration downloads and installs the prerequisites for PHP, downloads PHP, registers the PHP CGI module with IIS and sets the system environment variable that PHP needs to run.

Note: This example is intended to be used as a composite resource, so it does not use Configuration Data.
Please see the [Composite Configuration Blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/archive/2014/02/25/reusing-existing-configuration-scripts-in-powershell-desired-state-configuration.aspx) on how to use this configuration in another configuration.

```powershell

## Stopping the default website

When configuring a new IIS server, several references recommend removing or stopping the default website for security purposes.
This example sets up your IIS web server by installing IIS Windows Feature.
After that, it will stop the default website by setting `State = Stopped`.

```powershell
Configuration Sample_xWebsite_StopDefault
{
    param
    (
        # Target nodes to apply the configuration
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost'
    )
    # Import the module that defines custom resources
    Import-DscResource -Module xWebAdministration
    Node $NodeName
    {
        # Install the IIS role
        WindowsFeature IIS
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = "Web-Server"
        }
        # Stop the default website
        xWebsite DefaultSite
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = "Default Web Site"
            State           = "Stopped"
            PhysicalPath    = "C:\inetpub\wwwroot"
            DependsOn       = "[WindowsFeature]IIS"
        }
    }
}
```

### Create a new website

While setting up IIS and stopping the default website is interesting, it isn’t quite useful yet.
After all, people typically use IIS to set up websites of their own with custom protocol and bindings.
Fortunately, using DSC, adding another website is as simple as using the File and xWebsite resources to copy the website content and configure the website.

```powershell
Configuration Sample_xWebsite_NewWebsite
{
    param
    (
        # Target nodes to apply the configuration
        [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost',
        # Name of the website to create
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [String]$WebSiteName,
        # Source Path for Website content
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [String]$SourcePath,
        # Destination path for Website content
        [Parameter(Mandatory)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [String]$DestinationPath
    )

    # Import the module that defines custom resources
    Import-DscResource -Module xWebAdministration
    Node $NodeName
    {
        # Install the IIS role
        WindowsFeature IIS
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = "Web-Server"
        }

        # Install the ASP .NET 4.5 role
        WindowsFeature AspNet45
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = "Web-Asp-Net45"
        }

        # Stop the default website
        xWebsite DefaultSite
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = "Default Web Site"
            State           = "Stopped"
            PhysicalPath    = "C:\inetpub\wwwroot"
            DependsOn       = "[WindowsFeature]IIS"
        }

        # Copy the website content
        File WebContent
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            SourcePath      = $SourcePath
            DestinationPath = $DestinationPath
            Recurse         = $true
            Type            = "Directory"
            DependsOn       = "[WindowsFeature]AspNet45"
        }

        # Create the new Website with HTTPS
        xWebsite NewWebsite
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = $WebSiteName
            State           = "Started"
            PhysicalPath    = $DestinationPath
            BindingInfo     = @(
                MSFT_xWebBindingInformation
                {
                    Protocol              = "HTTPS"
                    Port                  = 8443
                    CertificateThumbprint = "71AD93562316F21F74606F1096B85D66289ED60F"
                    CertificateStoreName  = "WebHosting"
                },
                MSFT_xWebBindingInformation
                {
                    Protocol              = "HTTPS"
                    Port                  = 8444
                    CertificateThumbprint = "DEDDD963B28095837F558FE14DA1FDEFB7FA9DA7"
                    CertificateStoreName  = "MY"
                }
            )
            DependsOn       = "[File]WebContent"
        }
    }
}
```

### Creating the default website using configuration data

In this example, we’ve moved the parameters used to generate the website into a configuration data file.
All of the variant portions of the configuration are stored in a separate file.
This can be a powerful tool when using DSC to configure a project that will be deployed to multiple environments.
For example, users managing larger environments may want to test their configuration on a small number of machines before deploying it across many more machines in their production environment.

Configuration files are made with this in mind.
This is an example configuration data file (saved as a .psd1).

```powershell
Configuration Sample_xWebsite_FromConfigurationData
{
    # Import the module that defines custom resources
    Import-DscResource -Module xWebAdministration

    # Dynamically find the applicable nodes from configuration data
    Node $AllNodes.where{$_.Role -eq "Web"}.NodeName
    {
        # Install the IIS role
        WindowsFeature IIS
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = "Web-Server"
        }

        # Install the ASP .NET 4.5 role
        WindowsFeature AspNet45
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = "Web-Asp-Net45"
        }

        # Stop an existing website (set up in Sample_xWebsite_Default)
        xWebsite DefaultSite
        {
            Ensure          = "Present"
            Name            = "Default Web Site"
            State           = "Stopped"

            Recurse         = $true
            Type            = "Directory"
            DependsOn       = "[WindowsFeature]AspNet45"
        }

        # Create a new website
